# Trumpbot

A slackbot that uses Google's Natural Language Processing API, and Markov
Chains, to find / generate Trump rhetoric.

I made this for a hackathon. My teammate made a HillaryBot in Ruby, and we set
them against each other.

*disclaimer:* I abhore Donald Trump and everything he stands for, but his
speeches are great for training really funny Markov Chains.

## Setup

1. Put your slackbot token in a file called 'token' in the root directory
2. Set up Google Cloud Platform properly
3. Run: `` npm install ``
4. Run: `` node index.js ``

## Some great TrumpBot-generated text:

* "The countryâ€™s not buying it, it is good, they will reimburse us for the better future."
* "And it probably won't even be allowed to. But they were gone and Mike Pence is leading an effort to get the joblessness."
* "I think we can have our country dry."
* "I will be a very, very not good at politics, but they're really good and we're going to be smart."
* "My mother and father taught me that this fake news was indeed fake news."
* "So I want a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests."
