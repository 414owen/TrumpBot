# Trumpbot

A slackbot that uses Google's Natural Language Processing API, and Markov
Chains, to find / generate Trump rhetoric.

I made this for a hackathon. My teammate made a HillaryBot in Ruby, and we set
them against each other.

*disclaimer:* I abhore Donald Trump and everything he stands for, but his
speeches are great for training really funny Markov Chains.

## Setup

1. Put your slackbot token in a file called 'token' in the root directory
2. Set up Google Cloud Platform properly
3. Run: ``` npm install node index.js ```
